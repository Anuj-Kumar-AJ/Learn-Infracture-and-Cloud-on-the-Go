# TLS --> transport layer Security

    - TLS adds encryption to TCP.
    - TLS is an add-on to the TCP/IP suite and is not considered to be
        part of the base operation for TCP.
    -HTTP transactions can be completed without TLS but are
        not secure from eavesdroppers on the wire. TLS is a combination of protocols used to ensure traffic is seen between the sender and the intended recipient.
    - TLS, much like TCP, uses a handshake to establish encryption capabilities and exchange keys for encryption.

## steps detail the TLS handshake between the client and the server

```
    1. ClientHello: This contains the cipher suites supported by the client and a random number.

    2. ServerHello: This message contains the cipher it supports and a random number.

    3. ServerCertificate: This contains the server’s certificate and its server public key.

    4. ServerHelloDone: This is the end of the ServerHello. If the client receives a requestfor its certificate, it sends a ClientCertificate message.

    5. ClientKeyExchange: Based on the server’s random number, our client generates a random premaster secret, encrypts it with the server’s public key certificate, and sends it to the server.

    6. Key Generation: The client and server generate a master secret from the premaster secret and exchange random values.

    7. ChangeCipherSpec: Now the client and server swap their ChangeCipherSpec to begin using the new keys for encryption.

    8. Finished Client: The client sends the finished message to confirm that the key exchange and authentication were successful.

    9. Finished Server: Now, the server sends the finished message to the client to end the handshake.
```
    

**cipher suite is a combination of  algorithms used to secure communications over the internet. It includes the cryptographic protocols used for key exchanges and authentication and encryption/decription. commenly used cyphetr suite is AES(advanced encryption standard ) and RSA (rivestshamir-adleman)**

# UDP

- UDP offers an alternative to applications that do not need the reliability that TCP provides.
- UDP is an excellent choice for applications that can withstand packet loss such as voice and DNS
- UDP offers little overhead from a network perspective, only having four fields and no data acknowledgment, unlike its verbose brother TCP.
- It is transaction-oriented, suitable for simple query and response protocols like the Domain
Name System (DNS) and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). UDP slices a
request into datagrams, making it capable for use with other protocols for tunneling like a
virtual private network (VPN)
- It is lightweight and straightforward, making it great for bootstrapping application data in the case of DHCP
- The stateless nature of data transfer makes UDP perfect for applications, such as voice, that can withstand packet loss—did you
hear that? UDP’s lack of retransmit also makes it an apt choice for streaming video.


## UDP datagram [ diagram]()

```
1. Source port number (2 bytes) :-  
    Identifies the sender’s port. The source host is the client; the port number is ephemeral.
UDP ports have well-known numbers like DNS on 53 or DHCP 67/68.

2. Destination port number (2 bytes) :-  
    Identifies the receiver’s port and is required.

3. Length (2 bytes)  :-  
    Specifies the length in bytes of the UDP header and UDP data. The minimum length is 8 bytes, the length of the header.

4. Checksum (2 bytes) :-  
    Used for error checking of the header and data. It is optional in IPv4, but mandatory in
IPv6, and is all zeros if unused.

**for kubernetes**

    UDP and TCP are general transport protocols that help ship and receive data between hosts.
Kubernetes supports both protocols on the network, and services allow users to load balance
many pods using services. Also important to note is that in each service, developers must
define the transport protocol; if they do not TCP is the default used.

#### The next layer in the TCP/IP stack is the Internetworking layer—these are packets that can get sent across the globe on the vast networks that make up the internet. Let’s review how that gets completed.


# Network Layer

- In tcp/ip model, the network layer is responsible for provideing logical addressing and routing servidcs. It enables communications between devices on different network, even if thouse networks use different technological protocols.
- Outgoing packets select the next-hop host and send the data to that host by passing it the appropriate Link layer details packets are received by a host, de-encapsulated, and sent up to the proper Transport layer protocol
- In IPv4, both transmit and receive, IP provides fragmentation or defragmentation of packets based on the MTU; this is the maximum size of the IP packet
- IP makes no guarantees about packets’ proper arrival; since packet delivery across diversenetworks is inherently unreliable and failure-prone, that burden is with the endpoints of a communication path, rather than on the network
- providing service reliability is a function of the Transport layer. Each packet has a checksum to ensure that the received packet’s information is accurate, but this layer does not validate data integrity. Source and destination IP addresses identify packets on the network


## The network layer is responsible of following function  :- 

```
    1. logical addressing :- 
        each devices on the network assigned a unique logical address called IP address . The network layer used these address to identify the source and destiation of the packets , and to route the packet through the network to its destination

    2. Routing :- 
        the network layer is responsible for finding th best path for a packets to tak from its source to destination . It does this by using the routing table that contain information about the available paths through the network

    3. fragmentation and reassemble :-
        if the packet is too large to be transmitted over a perticulat link, the network layer can fragment the packet into smaller unit called datagram , and transmitt them saperately, at the detinatation, the network layer reassembles the datagrams into the original packet.

    4. Error checking :- 
        the network layer can also perform error checking to ensure that the packet was transmitted correctely. If an error is detected , the network layer can request that the packet be retransmitted
