IPv4 header format  --> [diagram](./assets/IPv4.png)


- This almighty packet is defined in RFC 791 and is used for sending data across networks.


**Few things to know about RFC 791**

```
    RFC 791 is the Internet Protocol (IP) specification as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It was first published in September 1981 and is considered one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite, which is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. The protocol defines the format of packets, also called datagrams, and the rules for forwarding them through a network. It is responsible for addressing and routing packets from the source host to the destination host.

    The main goal of IP is to provide a datagram delivery service in a packet-switched network. It is designed to be a connectionless, best-effort delivery service, meaning that it does not establish or maintain virtual connections between hosts, and it does not guarantee that packets will be delivered in a timely or reliable manner. However, IP provides a foundation for other protocols, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), to build on, which can provide these types of services.

    The IP datagram is the basic unit of information in IP. It consists of a header and a data area. The header contains information about the IP version, the length of the datagram, the source and destination IP addresses, and other fields that are used for routing and error checking. The data area is used to carry the payload, which can be any upper-layer protocol data.

    One of the key concepts of IP is its ability to break large messages into smaller packets, called fragmentation, and reassemble them at the destination. This allows IP to adapt to different network path characteristics, such as maximum transmission unit (MTU) size. IP also includes a mechanism for error checking, called the header checksum, which is used to detect errors in the header and options fields of the datagram.

    IP also includes a Time-To-Live (TTL) field, which specifies a maximum number of hops that a packet can traverse before it is discarded. This is used to prevent infinite loops and to limit the scope of a broadcast.

    IP version 4 (IPv4) is described in this RFC, and is the most widely used version of IP in use today. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit values and are represented in a dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.0.2.1). The addressing structure allows for a maximum of about 4 billion unique addresses, but due to the rapid growth of the internet, the pool of available addresses is becoming depleted. This led to the development of IPv6, which uses 128-bit addresses, providing a much larger address space.

    Overall, RFC 791 provides a detailed description of the Internet Protocol (IP) version 4 and its operation and architecture, it was considered a milestone for the internet and the way that it defined the packet structure, addressing and routing is still being used today and forms the backbone of the internet.

- **lets look at the IPv4 header in more detail** :-


1. **Version**
The first header field in the IP packet is the four-bit version field. For IPv4, this is always
equal to four.

1. **Internet Header Length (IHL)**
The IPv4 header has a variable size due to the optional 14th field option.

1. **Type of Service**
Originally defined as the type of service (ToS), now Differentiated Services Code Point
(DSCP), this field specifies differentiated services. DSC Pallows for routers and networks
to make decisions on packet priority during times of congestion. Technologies such as
Voice over IP use DSCP to ensure calls take precedence over other traffic.

1. **Total Length**
This is the entire packet size in bytes.

1. **Identification**
This is the identification field and is used for uniquely identifying the group of fragments
of a single IP datagram.

1. **Flags**
This is used to control or identify fragments. In order from most significant to least:
bit 0: Reserved, set to zero
bit 1: Do not Fragment
bit 2: More Fragments

1. **Fragment Offset**
This specifies the offset of a distinct fragment relative to the first unfragmented IP packet.
The first fragment always has an offset of zero.

1. **Time To Live (TTL)**
An 8-bit time to live field helps prevent datagrams from going in circles on a network.

1. **Protocol**This is used in the data section of the IP packet. IANA has a list of IP protocol numbers in
RFC 790; some well-known protocols are also detailed in [table](IP-ProtocolNumber.md).


1. **Header Checksum (16-bit)**
The IPv4 header checksum field is used for error checking. When a packet arrives, a
router computes the headerâ€™s checksum; the router drops the packet if the two values do not match. The encapsulated protocol must handle errors in the data field. Both UDP and TCP have checksum fields
**NOTE** - When the router receives a packet, it lowers the TTL field by one. As a consequence, the router must compute a new checksum

1. **Source address**
This is the IPv4 address of the sender of the packet
**NOTE** - The source address may be changed in transit by a network address translation device

1. **Destination address**
This is the IPv4 address of the receiver of the packet. As with the source address, a NAT device can change the destination IP address.

1. **Options**
The possible options in the header are Copied, Option Class, Option Number, Option
Length, and Option Data.
