<h1> TCP handshake </h1>
    
TCP uses a three-way handshakepictured in [check this](./assets/tcp3wayConnection.png), to create a connection by exchanging information along the way with various options and flags:

    1. The requesting node sends a connection request via a SYN packet to get the
        transmission started.
    2. The requesting node sends a connection request via a SYN packet to get the
        transmission started.
    3. The requesting node sends a connection request via a SYN packet to get the
        transmission started.

<b> after connection is stablished , On the local and remote hosts, a socket gets created to track this connection. A socket is just a logical endpoint for communication. </b>


    - TCP is a stateful protocol, tracking the connection’s state throughout its life cycle.
    - The state of the connection depends on both the sender and the receiver agreeing where they are in the connection flow.
    - The connection state is concerned about who is sending and receiving data in the TCP stream.
    - TCP has a complex state transition for explaining when and where the
        connection is, using the 9-bit TCP flags in the TCP segment header



The TCP connection states are: [check this](./assets/tcpStateTransitionDiagram.png)
```
    1. LISTEN (server)
        Represents waiting for a connection request from any remote TCP and port
    
    2. SYN-SENT (client)
        Represents waiting for a matching connection request after sending a connection request

    3. SYN-RECEIVED (server)
        Represents waiting for a confirming connection request acknowledgment after having
        both received and sent a connection request

    4. ESTABLISHED (both server and client)
        Represents an open connection; data received can be delivered to the user—the
        intermediate state for the data transfer phase of the connection

    5. FIN-WAIT-1 (both server and client)
        Represents waiting for a connection termination request from the remote host

    6. FIN-WAIT-2 (both server and client)
        Represents waiting for a connection termination request from the remote TCP

    7. CLOSE-WAIT (both server and client)
        Represents waiting for a local user’s connection termination request

    8. CLOSING (both server and client)
        Represents waiting for a connection termination request acknowledgment from the remote TCP

    9. LAST-ACK (both server and client)
        Represents waiting for an acknowledgment of the connection termination request
        previously sent to the remote host

    10. TIME-WAIT (either server or client)
        Represents waiting for enough time to pass to ensure the remote host received the
        acknowledgment of its connection termination request

    11. CLOSED (both server and client)
        Represents no connection state at all
