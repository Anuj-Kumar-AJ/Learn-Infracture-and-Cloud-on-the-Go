# Anatomy of IP address 

### IPv4 address
- IPv4 addresses are in the dotted-decimal notation for us humans; computers read them out as
binary strings. [Figure](assets/IPv4-Address.png)  details the dotted-decimal notation and binary. Each section is 8
bits in length, with four sections, making the complete length 32 bits.
- Pv4 addresses have
two sections: the first part is **the network**, and the second is the **host’s unique identifier** on the
network.


- The IP address also has a subnet mask or
netmask associated with it to make out what network it is assigned. The example’s subnet is
netmask 0xffffff00 in dotted-decimal, which is 255.255.255.0.


what this means is :-
```
    - An IP address, such as the one you provided (192.168.1.2), is a numerical label assigned to a device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. The subnet mask, which is also associated with the IP address, is used to divide the IP address into two parts: the network address and the host address. The subnet mask is used to identify which portion of the IP address represents the network address and which portion represents the host address.

    -The IP address you provided, 192.168.1.2, with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, is most likely a private IP address. This means that it is an IP address that is used within a local area network (LAN) and is not routable on the Internet. Such private IP addresses are typically used in home networks, small office networks, and other similar private networks.

    -The subnet 255.255.255.0 indicating that the first 24 bits of the IP address are used for the network address, and the remaining 8 bits are used for the host address. And this network is capable of hosting 2^8-2 = 254 devices, and it's a Class C network.

```


- The subnet brings up the idea of classful addressing. Initially, when an IP address range was
assigned, a range was considered to be the combination of an 8-, 16-, or 24-bit network prefix
along with a 24-, 16-, or 8-bit host identifier, respectively. Class A had 8 bits for the host,
Class B 16, and Class C 24. Following that, Class A had 2 to the power of 16 hosts available,
16,777,216; Class B had 65,536; and Class C had 256. Each class had a host address, the first
one in its boundary, and the last one was designated as the broadcast address  [check DIagram](assets/IPClass.png)

what this means is :-

```
In classful addressing, the Internet Protocol (IP) address space was divided into three classes: Class A, B, and C. The class of an IP address was determined by the value of the most significant bits of the IP address, also known as the network prefix.

    Class A addresses used the first 8 bits as the network prefix and the remaining 24 bits as the host identifier. This meant that the first octet (or 8 bits) of the IP address indicated the class of the address and the network it belonged to. The range of Class A addresses was from 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0. These IP address ranges allowed for a maximum of 2^24 (16,777,216) host addresses per network.
    Class B addresses used the first 16 bits as the network prefix and the remaining 16 bits as the host identifier. The range of Class B addresses was from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0. These IP address ranges allowed for a maximum of 2^16 (65,536) host addresses per network.
    Class C addresses used the first 24 bits as the network prefix and the remaining 8 bits as the host identifier. The range of Class C addresses was from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0. These IP address ranges allowed for a maximum of 2^8 (256) host addresses per network.

In classful addressing, the first address in the range of IP addresses for a given class was typically reserved as the network address, and the last address in the range was reserved as the broadcast address. The network address is used to identify the network and is used to route the packets to the correct network while the broadcast address is used to broadcast the packet to all the host on the network.

The main drawback of classful addressing was that it didn't take into account the actual number of IP addresses needed by an organization. For example, a large organization with many devices might only need a few hundred IP addresses, but would be allocated a Class A range with over 16 million addresses. This resulted in a significant waste of IP addresses, which led to the development of Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) to create more fine-grained subnets and more efficient utilization of IP addresses.
```


- Classful addressing, as explained earlier, is a way of dividing the IP address space into three classes: Class A, B, and C. Each class has a fixed number of bits for the network prefix and the host identifier, which limits the flexibility in how IP addresses are assigned and used.

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) was developed to address the limitations of classful addressing by allowing for more fine-grained subnets and more efficient utilization of IP addresses.

In CIDR, IP addresses are assigned using a prefix notation, which includes both the network prefix and the host identifier bits. This allows for a more flexible way of defining subnets and more efficient use of IP addresses. The prefix notation also eliminates the need to divide the IP address space into classes.

For example, a CIDR notation of /24 would indicate that the first 24 bits of the IP address are used as the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits are used as the host identifier. This allows for a subnet with a range of IP addresses from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255 and supports up to 254 IP addresses.

The main advantage of CIDR is its ability to make use of the IP addresses more efficiently, by breaking up the class boundaries, network engineers can move the subnet boundary to anywhere inside the class range, giving them more flexibility in the way IP addresses are assigned and used. CIDR notation also allows for a more scalable addressing scheme for the internet.

CIDR provides a way to make the most out of the available IP addresses by allowing for more fine-grained subnets and more efficient utilization of IP addresses. It also helps to scale IP address ranges, by breaking up class boundaries and providing more flexibility in how IP addresses are assigned and used.


**lets take example to understand it**

In [diagram](assets/CIDR.png) , we can see the breakdown of the 208.130.29.33 IPv4 address and the
hierarchy that it creates. The 208.128.0.0/11 CIDR range is assigned to ARIN from
IANA. ARIN further breaks down the subnet to smaller and smaller subnets for its purposes,
leading to the single host on the network 208.130.29.33/32

<br><br>

### The global coordination of the DNS root, IP addressing, and other internet protocol resources is performed by IANA

<br><br>
- Despite the advantages of CIDR in extending the range of IPv4 addresses and making more efficient use of IP address space, the continued growth of the internet and the increasing number of devices connecting to it led to an exhaustion of the available IPv4 address space.

The IPv4 address space has a total of about 4.3 billion addresses, which seemed more than enough when the Internet was first created. However, as the number of devices connecting to the internet grew, the available IPv4 address space became increasingly scarce. This led to the development of IPv6, a new version of IP that provides a much larger address space to accommodate the growing number of devices and networks.

IPv6 addresses have 128 bits, compared to the 32 bits of IPv4 addresses. This increases the number of possible addresses to 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456, or roughly 340 undecillion. This allows for a much larger number of unique addresses, making IPv6 well suited to the internet of things (IoT) and other large-scale networks.




# IPv6 --> [diagram](assets/IPv6.png)


- IPv6 also includes new features and improvements over IPv4, such as improved security, support for multicast and anycast addresses, and automatic address configuration. IPv6 is gradually being adopted by internet service providers and organizations worldwide, to ensure a sustainable future for the internet.

**IPv6 also includes several new features and improvements over IPv4 that can enhance security, functionality, and scalability of the internet. Some of these features include:**

    Improved security: IPv6 includes built-in security features such as IPSec, which is a framework of open standards for ensuring private, secure communications over IP networks. This allows for better protection of network communications, especially for sensitive data such as financial or personal information.

    Multicast addresses: IPv6 includes support for multicast addresses, which allow for one-to-many communication. This is useful for broadcasting information to multiple recipients, such as streaming video or audio.

    Anycast addresses: IPv6 also includes support for anycast addresses, which allow for one-to-nearest communication. This is useful for routing traffic to the closest available server in a network, such as for load balancing or content delivery.

    Automatic address configuration: IPv6 includes the ability for devices to automatically configure their IP addresses and other networking information, eliminating the need for manual configuration. This makes it easier to connect new devices to the network and can reduce the amount of administrative work.

    Extension headers: IPv6 introduces extension headers, this allows to carry options or information that are not present in the IPv6 header



- In [diagram](assets/IPv6.png), we can see that IPv6, unlike IPv4, uses hexadecimal to shorten addresses for writing purposes. It has similar characteristics to IPv4 in that it has a host and network prefix.

<br><br>
**Now that we understand how an individual host on the network is identified and what
network it belongs to, we will explore how those networks exchange information between
themselves using routing protocols**


## Getting round the network

- Routing is the process of moving data packets from one network to another. When a device wants to send a packet to another device on a different network, it needs to know how to reach that destination. Routing protocols are used by routers to exchange information about the networks they know about and to determine the best path to reach a destination.

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a routing protocol that is used to manage how packets are routed between edge routers on the internet. It is considered a dynamic routing protocol, which means it can adapt to changes in the network. BGP is used to exchange routing information between routers in different autonomous systems (AS), or groups of networks under the same administrative control.

BGP routers establish a peering session with their neighbors, and exchange routing information in the form of BGP update messages. The routers use this information to build routing tables that contain information about the networks reachable through their neighbors and the best path to reach those networks.

BGP routers use a routing algorithm to determine the best path to a destination based on various metrics such as hop count, delay, and bandwidth. Once a path is selected, the router will forward packets along that path.

Kubernetes network implementations can use BGP to route cluster network traffic between nodes. Kubernetes nodes can be spread across multiple networks and multiple locations. BGP can be used to determine the best path to reach a node on a different network. By using BGP to route traffic, Kubernetes can ensure that packets are delivered to their destinations through the most efficient path, even if the nodes are in different locations or on different networks.

In summary, routing protocols like BGP are used by routers to exchange information about the networks they know about and to determine the best path to reach a destination. BGP is a dynamic routing protocol that is particularly important for managing routing on the internet. Some Kubernetes network implementations use BGP to route cluster network traffic between nodes, allowing for efficient and reliable communication between nodes even when they are on separate networks or in different locations.



- If we refer to the map of the internet in [Diagram](assets/Internet.png), each network on the internet is assigned a BGP autonomous system number (ASN) to designate a single administrative entity or corporation that represents a common and clearly defined routing policy on the internet. BGP and ASNs allows network administrators to maintain control of their internal network routing while announcing and summarizing their routes on the internet. [Table](assets/ASNs-available.png) lists the available ASNs managed by IANA and other regional entities.



### Lets take an example to understand it

consider a packet that needs to be sent from a host on network A to a host on network Z. The packet originates on host A and needs to be delivered to host Z.

    Host A looks up the destination IP address of host Z in its routing table. If it does not have a direct route to the destination network, it sends the packet to its default gateway.

    The default gateway, Router 1, receives the packet and looks up the destination IP address in its routing table. If it does not have a direct route to the destination network, it sends the packet to its next-hop router, Router 2, that connects to the internet

    Router 2 is part of Autonomous System (AS) 1, and it exchanges routing information with other routers in the same AS using Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) such as OSPF or EIGRP. It uses this information to determine the best path to the destination network

    Router 2 also uses Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) such as BGP to exchange routing information with routers in other AS on the internet. BGP is used to determine the best path to reach the destination network Z which is in different AS.

    Router 2 has a route to the destination network Z and sends the packet to its next-hop router, Router 3, that is connected to the destination network.

    Router 3 receives the packet and looks up the destination IP address in its routing table. If it has a direct route to the destination host, it sends the packet to host Z. If it does not have a direct route, it sends the packet to the next hop router until it reaches the destination host.

    Host Z receives the packet, and the communication is complete.

In this example, the packet was sent through multiple routers and autonomous systems to reach its destination. Routing protocols like IGP and EGP, and specifically BGP, were used to determine the best path for the packet to take based on information exchanged between routers.


to understand it with diagram :-

In [Figure](assets/BGP-Routing.png) ,we have five ASNs, 100–500. A host on 130.10.1.200 wants to reach ahost destined on 150.10.2.300. Once the local router or default gateway for the host
130.10.1.200 receives the packet, it will look for the interface and path for
150.10.2.300 that BGP has determined for that route.
Based on the routing table in [Figure](assets/tcp3wayConnection.png), the router for AS 100 determined the packet belongs to AS 300, and the preferred path is out interface 140.10.1.1. Rinse and repeat on AS 200 until the local router for 150.10.2.300 on AS 300 receives that packet. The flow
here is described in Figure 1-6, which shows the TCP/IP data flow between networks

[Figure](assets/locakRoutingTable.png) displays a local route table. In the route table, we can see the interface that a packet will be sent out is based on the destination IP address. For example, a packet destined for 192.168.1.153 will be sent out the link#11 gateway, which is local to the network, and no routing is needed. 192.168.1.254 is the router on the network attached to our
internet connection. If the destination network is unknown, it is sent out the default route.

Routers continuously communicate on the internet, exchanging route information and
informing each other of changes on their respective networks. BGP takes care of a lot of that
data exchange, but network engineers and system administrators can use the ICMP protocol
and ping command line tools to test connectivity between hosts and routers

## ICMP

- ICMP stands for Internet Control Message Protocol. It is a network protocol that is used to send error messages and operational information about network conditions. ICMP is an integral part of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite, and it is typically used by network devices, like routers, to send error messages indicating, for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.

- ICMP messages are typically generated in response to errors in IP datagrams, but they can also be sent in response to certain events, such as when a network becomes congested. ICMP messages are typically sent as a response to IP packets that are sent to an IP address or host that does not exist.

- There are several types of ICMP messages, including Echo Request and Echo Reply (ping), Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded, and Redirect. Each type of message serves a specific purpose, such as allowing a host to determine if another host is reachable on the network, or informing a host that a requested service is unavailable.

- Some security concern and exploit that can be done with malformed ICMP messages have been documented through the years, and it is a common practice to restrict the ICMP packet flow at firewall and router level


Lets talk about `ping`

- ping is a network utility that uses ICMP for testing connectivity between hosts on the
network

- When you use the "ping" command, the packets sent and returned contain an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request and echo reply message, respectively. These messages are used to determine whether a specific IP address is accessible and responsive.
When you run the "ping" command, it sends an ICMP echo request packet to the specified IP address, and the device at that address sends back an ICMP echo reply packet. The "ping" command then displays information about each packet sent and received, including the round-trip time it took for the packet to be sent and received. You can see the data contained in the ICMP packets by using a packet capture tool such as Wireshark or tcpdump. These tools allow you to capture and analyze the raw packet data sent and received on a network.

- In Example below, we see a successful ping test to 192.168.1.2, with five packets
all returning an ICMP echo reply.
```
○ → ping 192.168.1.2 -c 5
PING 192.168.1.2 (192.168.1.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.052 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.089 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.142 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.050 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.2: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.050 ms
--- 192.168.1.2 ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.050/0.077/0.142/0.036 ms
```

- Example below, shows a failed ping attempt that times out trying to reach host 1.2.3.4.
Routers and administrators will use ping for testing connections, and it is useful in testing
container connectivity as wel
```
○ → ping 1.2.3.4 -c 4
PING 1.2.3.4 (1.2.3.4): 56 data bytes
Request timeout for icmp_seq 0
Request timeout for icmp_seq 1
Request timeout for icmp_seq 2--- 1.2.3.4 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss
```


### LEts take an example to see  how to use tcpdump with ping request body

Here is an example of how to use the tcpdump command to capture and analyze ICMP packets sent and received in response to a "ping" command:

```
# Start a tcpdump capture on the eth0 interface and save the output to a file
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w ping.pcap icmp

# Send a ping request to an IP address
ping 8.8.8.8

# Stop the tcpdump capture
CTRL + C
```

- You can use the -i option to specify the network interface to capture packets on. In this example, I am using eth0 which is commonly the first network interface. The -w option is used to save the output to a file, this output file will be in pcap format which is readable by wireshark or other tools that can read the format. the icmp option is used to filter the capture to icmp packets only.

- Once the capture is complete, you can open the captured packet data file (ping.pcap in this example) with a packet analyzer such as Wireshark and view the details of the ICMP packets sent and received during the "ping" command. You can filter the traffic for ICMP by applying the filter icmp on wireshark to have a clear look at the packets.

- You can also use tcpdump command to print the packets on screen instead of saving them to file:
    `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 icmp`



- You can filter the packets you see by adding additional filter flags like:
    `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 icmp and host 8.8.8.8`
This command will print the packets on the screen and filter them by icmp and host IP 8.8.8.8


### To know more info about tcpdum uses [check this out](codeFile/tcpdumpDetail.md)



## ICMP packets contain headers, data , and options just like TCP and UDP. [check DIagram](assets/ICMP-header.png)

`Type`  -->     ICMP type.  <br>
`Code`  -->     ICMP subtype.   <br>
`Checksum`  --> Internet checksum for error checking, calculated from the ICMP header and data with value 0 substitutes for this field. <br>
`Rest of Header (4-byte field)`     --> Contents vary based on the ICMP type and code.  <br>
`Data`  --> ICMP error messages contain a data section that includes a copy of the entire IPv4 header.






### **NOTE** :-
 ICMP is considered to be a part of the Internet Layer of the OSI model and not the Transport Layer. It is a control protocol that is used to send error messages and operational information about network conditions, rather than carrying application data like TCP and UDP. ICMP does not use port numbers, unlike TCP and UDP, and it is not considered a transport protocol because it does not establish a connection or provide a reliable data transfer service like TCP does.
ICMP is used to provide feedback to the sender about the state of the network, such as whether a destination host or network is reachable, and also to provide troubleshooting information such as packet loss and round trip time. It is also used by routers to send error messages and redirects, and it is used by the ping and traceroute utilities to test connectivity and measure network performance.


- The Type field in the ICMP header identifies the type of ICMP message, and the Code field provides additional context or information about the message.
The Type field is an 8-bit field, and it can have a value between 0 and 255. Different values of the Type field indicate different types of ICMP messages, such as Echo Request (ping), Destination Unreachable, Redirect, Time Exceeded, Parameter Problem, Timestamp Request/Reply, and Information Request/Reply.
The Code field is also an 8-bit field, and it provides additional information about the message. The meaning of the Code field depends on the value of the Type field. For example, the Code field can indicate the specific type of error that occurred, or it can provide additional details about a redirect message.

- but we know that ip address changes all the time then why is the ip address not vhages even we run ` ifconfig ` all the time ?

```
The IP address for the interface shown in the output you provided (ens33) is not changing every time you run the ifconfig command because the IP address is being assigned to the interface using a static configuration, rather than through a DHCP server.

A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server assigns IP addresses to devices on a network dynamically, meaning that the IP addresses can change over time. However, if an IP address is assigned to a device through a static configuration, it will remain the same until it is manually changed.

It's also possible that the device is configured to retrieve its IP address via DHCP but it got assigned the same IP address during each DHCP lease, this could happen when DHCP server is configured to assign the same IP to the device based on its MAC address
```


- what is diffrernce between `ipconfig` and `ifconfig`

```
    ipconfig and ifconfig are both command-line tools that are used to display information about the network interfaces on a computer. However, they are used on different operating systems:

ipconfig is a command-line tool used on Windows-based computers to display the current configuration of the network interfaces, including the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. It can also be used to release and renew DHCP leases, flush the DNS cache, and register the computer's IP address with the DNS server.

ifconfig is a command-line tool used on Linux and Unix-based computers to display the current configuration of the network interfaces, including the IP address, subnet mask, and MAC address. It can also be used to configure the network interfaces, such as setting an IP address or enabling or disabling an interface.

Both ipconfig and ifconfig are used to view the network information, but they have some difference in usage and options. For example ifconfig can be used on Linux and other Unix-based operating systems, while ipconfig is specific to Windows.
You can also use ip command in Linux and unix systems which is the more updated version of ifconfig, it gives much more details and options.

# Now that our packets know which networks they are being sourced and destined to, it is time to start physically sending this data request across the network; this is the responsibility of the Link layer.
