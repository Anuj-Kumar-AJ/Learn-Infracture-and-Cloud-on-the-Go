# Anatomy of IP address 

### IPv4 address
- IPv4 addresses are in the dotted-decimal notation for us humans; computers read them out as
binary strings. [Figure](assets/IPv4-Address.png)  details the dotted-decimal notation and binary. Each section is 8
bits in length, with four sections, making the complete length 32 bits.
- Pv4 addresses have
two sections: the first part is **the network**, and the second is the **hostâ€™s unique identifier** on the
network.
