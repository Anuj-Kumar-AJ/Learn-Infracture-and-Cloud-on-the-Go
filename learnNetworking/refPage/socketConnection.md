# There are several tools that can be used to inspect sockets and connections on a Linux system. Here are a few examples:

`netstat`: This command provides information about the network status of the system, including open sockets and active connections. It can display information such as the state of a connection, the local and remote addresses, and the process that is associated with the socket.

`lsof`: This command stands for "list open files" and can be used to display information about files that are open by processes on the system, including sockets. It can provide similar information to netstat, such as the state of a connection, the local and remote addresses, and the process that is associated with the socket.

`ss`: This command is similar to netstat, but it is considered to be faster and more efficient. It provides information about open sockets and active connections on the system and can display the same information as netstat and lsof.

`tcpdump`: This command is a packet analyzer that can be used to capture and inspect network packets, including TCP and UDP packets. It can be useful for inspecting low-level details of sockets and connections.

`Wireshark`: This is a graphical tool that allows you to capture and inspect network packets in a user-friendly interface. It is similar to tcpdump but with more advanced features and a GUI.

`socat`: This command is a multipurpose relay for bidirectional data transfer. It can be used to create and inspect sockets, as well as to transfer data between sockets.

These are some examples of tools that can be used to inspect sockets and connections on a Linux system. Depending on the specific task and the level of detail required, different tools may be more suitable.
