   1. TCP/IP model
       - TCP/IP creates a heterogeneous network with open protocols that are independent of the operating system and architectural differences. Whether the hosts are running Windows, Linux, or another OS, TCP/IP allows them to communicate;
       - TCP/IP does not care if you are running Apache or Nginx for your web server at the Application layer.
        

    => compare TCP/IP with OSI model



OSI 
    application --> presentation --> session --> transport --> network --> dataLink --> physical

TCP/IP    
    application -------------------------------> transport --> internet -->  physical------------


        
        - application layer
           -  the Application layer comprises the communications protocols used in
process-to-process communications across an IP network.
           - The Application layer
standardizes communication and depends upon the underlying Transport layer protocols
to establish the host-to-host data transfer


        - Transport layer
            - TCP and UDP are the primary protocols of the Transport layer that provide host-to-host communication services for applications
            - Transport protocols are responsible for connection-oriented communication, reliability, flow control, and multiplexing
            -Each port identifies the host process responsible for processing the information from the network communicastion
            - . Each port on the server identifies its traffic, and the sender
generates a random port locally to identify itself.
            - The governing body that manages port number assignments is the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA); there are 65,535 prots

    
        - Internet/ Network layer
          -  The Internet, or Network layer, is responsible for transmitting data between networks
