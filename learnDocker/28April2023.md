- container is made to run a specific program or processes unlike the VMs which are created to host an OS. Meaning if we run `docker run ubuntu` usually we will see a container is running to run ubuntu OS. but its not the case , when you run `docker ps` you will se nothing, because here ubuntu is not running any processes inside of it, when there is no processes running in the container inside container the container will automatically stops. So the point is to keep running the container, it needed atleast one processes running.
