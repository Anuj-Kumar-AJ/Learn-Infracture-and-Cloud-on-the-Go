## about docker images

- lets create our oun imges of webserver which is build using python flask framwork
- the steps for that will be 
  - choose OS - ubuntu
  - update the apt repo
  - install dependences using `apt`
  - install python dependencies using `pip`
  - copy source code of our app to `/apt` folder 
  - run app using flask command 
 
 - curresponding `DockerFile` will be like
 ```
 FROM UBUNTU
 
 RUN apt-get update
 RUN apt-get install python
 
 RUN pip install flask
 RUN pip install flask-mysql
 
 copy . /opt/sourceCode
 
 ENTRYPOINT FLASK_APP= /opt/sourceCode/app.py flask run
 ```
 
 
- Now to build this dockerfile we use `docker build Dockerfile -t DockerUserName/custom-app`
- here `-t` is ued for tagging the app with appName , It is important to tag it or elece when we push the imge to dockerhub registory . It will try to send it in default registory which is not acesses by everyone only docker support can acess that , these contain all the official images. So ypu can only sned your imge to docker registory when you tag it while build processes.
 

-  to push this imgae ot dockerhub use `docker push dockerUSerName/custom-app`


- So dokerfile is build using `instructions` and `arguments` format. all the captals are instructions and next to them are arguments
 
- all the docker images are created in layerd format , where each line of htis docker file is a single layer, which are created on top of each other to create a docker image
- To check the history of how the image is formed using diffenrt layer , use `docker history imageName`
-  while performing `docker build` command the build is done in layerd manner and every layer is cached , so if during build process comething crashed, and we need to perform build again the build will be start from previous layer at which the buil dis crached. which make build process efficient.

- we can containerise everything, from simple command like `curl` to browser like `chrome` and even application like `spotify`. 

- To send the environment variable to webapp during build process we can use  `docker run -e envName=envValur imageName` 


### difference between `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`.

- CMD command will overwrite the whole command to the image
- ENTRYPOINT command will append the new command to old command writeen in dockerfile

for example 

```
FROM ubuntu

ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
CMD [5]
```

- when we run this image `docker run ubuntu-sleeper` now the program will check if we passed any argumnet which will be replaced in `CMD` , we havent here so `5` will be appended into entrypoint command i.e `sleep 5` . so the new command will become `sleep 5`.
- but let say we run image by `docker run ubuntu-sleeper 10`. now the CMD command will be replaced from `5 to 10`. new command will be `sleep 10`
