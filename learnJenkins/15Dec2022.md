    World before Jenkins: - 
        - Problem of waiting for code PR to validate , after pushing to resting environment
        - Problem of night build , can only update version og product at night
    
    What is Jenkins :-

        It is CI/CD tool, help in continuous integrationand deployment

    What Proble Jenkinf Solve
    
        - It help in running automated test in testing environment within jenkinsserver
        - dont have to wait for tester to test code manually and developer get feedback quickly of its PR
        - Can create build continuously which helps company to release new version of their product quickly


    Jenkins server Architecture
        
        - when code is submitted in code repo storage like github,
        - Jenkins take the code from code storage and run the test on Jenkins server
        - Lets talk about jenkins server architecture
            - jenking have a master server and slave server 
            - slave server have different environment like windows, macOS, linux
            - master node send the testing to slave node and take feedback related to testing of the code
            - then master node send feedback to the developer about their code if its test passes or not




       few theory
            - Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins that supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.
                Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as code" via the Pipeline DSL. 




    Jenkins File Creation
        - Decelerative
        - scriptive (only with groovy syntax )
        
   Pipeline can be created in one of the following ways:
        
        - Through Blue Ocean - after setting up a Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, the Blue Ocean UI helps you write your Pipeline’s Jenkinsfile and commit it to source control.

        - Through the classic UI - you can enter a basic Pipeline directly in Jenkins through the classic UI.

        -  In SCM - you can write a Jenkinsfile manually, which you can commit to your project’s source control repository.

1. enable the Jenkins service to start at boot
    	```sudo systectl enable jenkins```

2. start jenkins service
