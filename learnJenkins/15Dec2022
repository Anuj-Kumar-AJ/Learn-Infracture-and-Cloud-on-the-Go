    World before Jenkins: -

        - Problem of night build , can only update version og product at night
    
    What is Jenkins :-

        It is CI/CD tool, help in continuous integrationand deployment

    What Proble Jenkinf Solve
    
        - It help in running automated test in testing environment within jenkinsserver
        - dont have to wait for tester to test code manually and developer get feedback quickly of its PR
        - Can create build continuously which helps company to release new version of their product quickly


    Jenkins server Architecture
        
        - when code is submitted in code repo storage like github,
        - Jenkins take the code from code storage and run the test on Jenkins server
        - Lets talk about jenkins server architecture
            - jenking have a master server and slave server 
            - slave server have different environment like windows, macOS, linux
            - master node send the testing to slave node and take feedback related to testing of the code
            - then master node send feedback to the developer about their code if its test passes or not
