# Access Control and Rootly Powers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Access control is an area of active research, and it has long been one of the major
challenges of operating system design. Generically speaking, operating systems
define accounts for individual users, and they offer those users a smorgasbord of
possible operations: editing text files, logging into remote computers, setting the
system’s hostname, installing new software, and so on. The access control system
is the black box that considers potential actions (user/operation pairs) and issues
rulings as to whether each action is permissible.


## TRADITIONAL UNIX ACCESS CONTROL

- Even in earliest and simplest versions of UNIX, there was never a single-point
access control system. There were, however, some general rules that shaped the
system’s design:

    - Objects (e.g., files and processes) have owners. Owners have broad (but
    not necessarily unrestricted) control over their objects.
    - You own new objects that you create.
    - The special user account called “root” can act as the owner of any object.
    - Only root can perform certain sensitive administrative operations.

- There’s no single “black box” of access control because the code that makes access
control decisions is scattered about the system. For example, certain system calls
(e.g., settimeofday) are restricted to root; the system call implementation simply
checks the identity of the current user and rejects the operation if the user is not
root. Other system calls (e.g., kill) implement different calculations that involve
both ownership matching and special provisions for root
- Finally, the filesystem implements its own access control system, one that is more sophisticated than that found anywhere else in the kernel. Only the filesystem uses the concept of UNIX groups for access control,






### **Filesystem access control**


In traditional file systems, every file has an owner and a group, also known as the "group owner". The owner of a file is typically the user who created the file, and the group is a collection of users that have been assigned certain permissions to access and modify the file. The owner of the file can set permissions for the group and other users to read, write, or execute the file. This allows for fine-grained control over access to files and directories on a file system.
- The owner of a file is a single user, but multiple users can be part of the group owner of the file. These users are members of a specific group that has been assigned certain permissions for the file.

Traditionally, groups were defined in the /etc/group file on a local system. However, with the increasing use of networks and centralized authentication systems, group information is more commonly stored on a network server such as NIS (Network Information Service) or LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server. This allows for easy management of groups and permissions across multiple systems and devices on a network.

- In a Linux system, group information is typically stored in the /etc/group file. This file contains a list of all the groups defined on the system, along with the group name, `group ID (GID)`, and a list of the users who are members of the group.

The format of each line in the `/etc/group` file is as follows:

`group_name:password:GID:user_list`

The group_name is the name of the group, the password field is typically left blank, GID is the unique group ID, and user_list is a comma-separated list of users who are members of the group.

You can view the contents of the /etc/group file by running the command cat /etc/group in the terminal. And you can also modify the group information by editing the file with root privilege.

- The ownerships of a file can be determined with `ls -l` filename.

- Both the kernel and the filesystem track owners and groups as numbers rather
than as text names. In the most basic case, `user identification numbers (UIDs` for
short) are mapped to usernames in the /etc/passwd file, and group identification
numbers (GIDs) are mapped to group names in /etc/group. The text names that
correspond to UIDs and GIDs are defined only for the convenience of the system’s
human users. When commands such as ls want to display ownership information
in a human-readable format, they must look up each name in the appropriate file
or database


### Process ownership

- The real UID and GID are used for accounting purposes, such as keeping track of who owns a process. The effective UID and GID, on the other hand, are used to determine access permissions. They are used to check whether a user has the necessary privileges to perform a certain action or access a certain resource. In most cases, the real and effective UID and GID are the same.

- The saved UID and GID, also known as saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID, have no direct effect on the process's access permissions. They allow a program to temporarily park an inactive UID or GID for later use, which facilitates the parsimonious use of enhanced privileges. It is a mechanism that allows a process to drop its privilege level temporarily and then regain it later if needed.

- Under Linux, there is also a "filesystem UID" which is used only to determine file access permissions. This is typically explained as an implementation detail of NFS (Network File System) and is usually the same as the effective UID.

- In summary, a process in UNIX has multiple identities associated with it, including real, effective, and saved UID and GID, and a filesystem UID. These identities are used to determine access permissions and control the process, with the `real IDs used for accounting` <br>
and `the effective IDs used to determine access permissions`. <br>
The `saved IDs are used to temporarily park an inactive ID for later use`, <br>
and the `filesystem UID is used to determine file access permissions under NFS`.


### The root account

- The root account is UNIX’s omnipotent administrative user. It’s also known as the
superuser account, although the actual username is “root”.

- The defining characteristic of the root account is its `UID of 0.` Nothing prevents
you from changing the username on this account or from creating additional ac-
counts whose UIDs are 0; however, these are both bad ideas. Such changes have a
tendency to create inadvertent breaches of system security. They also create con-
fusion when other people have to deal with the strange way you’ve configured
your system

- Traditional UNIX allows the superuser (that is, any process whose effective UID
is 0) to perform any valid operation on any file or process.

- Examples of restricted operations are
    - Changing the root directory of a process with `chroot`
    - Creating device files
    - Setting the system clock
    - Raising resource usage limits and process priorities
    - Setting the system’s hostname
    - Configuring network interfaces
    - Opening privileged network ports (those numbered below 1,024)
    - Shutting down the system



- An example of superuser powers is the ability of a process owned by root to
change its UID and GID . the The login program and its window system equivalents
are a case in point; the process that prompts you for your password when you log
in to the system initially runs as root. If the password and username that you enter
are legitimate, the login program changes its UID and GID to your UID and GID
and starts up your user environment. Once a root process has changed its owner-
ships to become a normal user process, it can’t recover its former privileged state.





## Setuid and setgid execution

- Traditional UNIX access control is a system that is used to control who can access and perform certain actions on a UNIX system. This system is composed of two parts: the kernel and the filesystem. The kernel is the core part of the operating system and the filesystem is where files and directories are stored. Together, they work to implement an identity substitution system.

- This system allows special executable files to run with elevated permissions, usually those of the root user. This is done by setting a special permission bit called "`setuid"` or `"setgid"` on the executable file. When the kernel runs a file with these permission bits set, it changes the effective user or group ID of the resulting process to the user or group ID of the file containing the program, instead of the user or group ID of the person who ran the command. This means that the user's privileges are temporarily elevated for the execution of that specific command only.

- An example of this is the `"passwd"` command, which is used to change a user's password. Since the password information is stored in a protected file called `/etc/shadow`, regular users need a way to access this file and change their own password. The `passwd command` has the `setuid` permission bit set, so when a user runs the command, the kernel elevates their privileges to that of the root user, allowing them to change their own password. However, the passwd command also has built-in logic that checks who is running it and only allows them to change their own password, while the root user can change any password.
