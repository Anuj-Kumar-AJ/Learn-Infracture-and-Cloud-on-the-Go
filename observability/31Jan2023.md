# what is observability

- observability is the ability to measure or find the internal state of the system , by looking at the data produced by the system
- observability help us in figuring out the action we need to perform when something goes wrong with our system, by looking at the different types of data it generate like logs

# why do we need observability

- In monolythic application, the need for observability was not much needed becaus whole system was tightly coupled and they are present in single server. so we can just look at the log and figure out what goes wrong
- but in microservice architecture the need for observability was at peak , because there are soo many system that connect with one another and if there is no onservability we cant figure out from all these many system what causes our servie to fail.

## what troubbleshooting needs
    - we need more then just what is wrong with the system
    - we need to know why our application entered specific state
    - what  component responsible for it
    - how to avoide it in future

    - why are error rate rising
    - why is there high latency
    - why are services timing out


# what does observability help with

 - give better insites into the internal working of sytem or application
 - speed up troubleshooting
 - detect hard catch problems
 - monitor perforamce of an application
 - imporve cross-team collaboration



# 3 main pillars of observability

- logging
- traces
- metirics


## logs 

- logs are the records of events that have occured which causes the system to reach certain state which we called system failure
- it contiain every information which happed with the sytem

- logs contain
    - timestamps of when the log occurs
    - message containing inforamtion

- well logs cant help us fully in micro-service based architecture . but why?
- well in monolythic architecture there all the components was present in one system so the logs will be used to troubleshoot . But woth microservice based architecture there are soo many component which talk to each other multiple time and the log will containe information of all the processes but the problem is many different component logs are interwoven together which causes us problem to figure out which log of component
- and another problem is theire verbosity -- verbosity means showing high amount of information of each processes the component gone through, so it is tough for us to understad the logs



## Traces

- so what traces does is it help us to follow the operation from processes to processes from all the system the component is spread across.

- you can think of the traces as , the debugger compiler provides. meaning our code traverse and stop from breakpoints to breakpoints we introduced. to see , what happed at every breakpoint. Same the breakpoint is the different componets and we just traverse at them slowly from one processes to another

- each trace have a `trace_id` , which help us to identify the request as it tracerse from one system to another

- each individual event which are forming a trace are called `spans`

- each span tracks
    - start-time --> of the process 
    - Duration  --> in which the process runs
    - Parent_id 


## Metrics

- Metric is a bit different from both traces and log, It contain the numeric information like
    - cpu load
    - number of openfiles
    - HTTP response times
    - numbers of errors

- these data can be assembled over time to plot a graph using visualization tools to identify `trends of system over time`.



- MEtric contain 4 pieces of inforamtion
    - metric name   --> name of hte metic 
    - metric value  --> most recent or the corrent value of the metics
    - Timestamp --> for the metric
    - dimentions    --> additional information about metic
