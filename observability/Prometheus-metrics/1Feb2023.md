#----- Prometheus Fundamental -------------

# PRometheus Basics

- prometheus is monitoring tool that collects the metric data and also it provide tools for visuilaze that collected data.

- lets se how permetheus do that . So basically permitheus scrape the data from target that expose the metics through its HTTP endpoints.

- that scraped data then stored in time-series database which can be queried using , through prometheus built-in query language PrompQl


- So lets see what kind of metric data prometheus monitor
    - cpu or memory utilization
    - Disk soace
    - Service Uptime
    - application specific data like
        - number of exceptions
        - latency
        - pending request

- **Its important to note that prometheus is designed for only timnumeric data**


# Prometheus Architecture

- PRemetheus have  different component or we can say workers
    1. Retrieval unit --> It scrapes the metric data from different sources by sending http request and the receive the data 
    2. TSDB --> It then stored that received the metric data in `Time-series Databases` .
    3. HTTP server --> And finally it have the `HTTP server` which is used to acess data from databases to visualise the metric data , It accepts PromQL Query for retrieval of data.

    4. `Exporters` --> So exporters are the mini processes run on the target server from which we need to scrape metric data. But why need exporters ? well the target servers not always expose data in a form which is easily understandable to prometheus for scraping, so this exported will take the data and convert it so that the retrieval unit can easily scrape those data. So which means the prometheus will query the data on target and then scrape it , its not target send the data to prometheus.

    5. `push gateway` --> lets say a situation when the job dont last long for prometheus to scrape the data , i.e that job is `short lived jobs` . So then that data we lost right, to retrieve that data , prometheus uses `push gateway`, So basically the target will push the data from short-lived jobs to `push gateway` and then prometheus will query the data from this push gateway.

    6. `Service Discovery` --> well prometheus want user to hard-code all the target from where we want prometheus to scrape metics data. But due to dynamic nature of k8s or EC2 instances , the target is not fixed , as number of node get increases and decrease accouding to need of the services or traffic. So for this dynainc situations `service discovery` come to play, what it does is it dynamically update the list of target so that we dont have to hardcode the value ourself.

    7. `Alert manager` --> So well prometheus not resoponsible itself to send the alert when something goes wrong with system while monitoring the data, like cpu usage get more then 90%, so it send the `push alert` to the `alert manager` which is responsible for the alerting the user using provided integration like **slack**, **gmail** or any integration we use.

    8. `acessing the data` --> so we use the prometheus UI or tool like grafana to visualize the metric data.


- So by default prometheus uses `/metric` endpoints for collecting data in target, but we can consomize or change the url of the endpoint according to needs, in prometheus configuration file.

- most system dont collect and export the metric data in `http` endpoint , so here `exporter` was installed in the target and then it collect the metric data and then convert in to form which is consumed by prometheus , and then expose this metric in `/metric` endpoint.


- There are different types of exporter in prometheus
    - node exporter --> for linux servers
    - windows
    - MySQL
    - Apache
    - HAProxy


- For monitoring the application metrics, prometheus comes with many `client liberaries`, that allow us to expose any application metrics , we need prometheus to track
    

- There are two type of system for collecting metrics data
    - pull based system --> in this system monitoring tool will send http request and pull the data . some of the pull based tools are
        - prometheus
        - zabix
        - nagios

    - `Push based system` --> in this sytem the server or worker will send the metric data to preconfigured IP(of monitoring tool) . some of push based tools are
        - Graphite
        - OpenTSDB
        - Logstash




### some of the benifits of pull based system
    - in pull based system it is easier to tell if the target is down. but in push based system it is tough to know that if the target is down ot it have been decommitioned.
    - Push based system can potiontially overload the metric server , if too many incomming connections get flodded at some time
    - pull based system have definite list of target to monitor , creating central source of truth

### So why push based system is here in the first place.
    - so in event based systems pulling data woult not be possible
    - short lived jobs will be a problem for pull based system, as there is possiblity that short lived jobs will be not there in next pull.





# Instalation of prometheus 

- go to website and `https://prometheus.io/download/` and the select the binary according to your system architecture

- after installation in unix or linux go to path where prometheus is installed in .tar format
- then untar it by running `tar xvf prometheusTarFileName`
- the go inside the prometheus folder

- and run ./prometheus 
- this will run the prometheus and expose it on local host with port `9090`

- go to local host with port 9090 `http://localhost:9090`


- **NOTE** --> the probelm with this method is when terminal stops prometheus will also stops.

- so lets start prometheus as any process using `systemctl`

# Prometheus installation using systemd

- first step is create the user prometheus
    - `sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false prometheus`
        - lets see what `--no-create-home --shell /bin/false` do
            - so bassically it make user such that no one can login with this prometheus user, and also no one can use shell as prometheus user, because we dont want to run system as prometheus user, rather we want to run prometheus usinf this user

- lets add the configuration file of prometheus which is present in premetheus folder which is untared before. and place it in `etc/prometheus` directory
    - `sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus`

- now lets create a directory where all the data (time-series) which prometeus scrape will resides.
    - `sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus

- lets give permission to user and group `premetheus` we created to theses both directory
    - `sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus`
    - `sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus`

- you may think that how group prometheus created which i give permission , well whenever a user created then a group also created with same name. 
- `to know more about user and group check my linux directory i have explaned it there` --> [linux](../../Linux/)


- now move your executables in /user/local/bin
    - cp prometheus /usr/local/bin/

- now move your promtool to /user/local/bin
    - cp promtool /usr/local/tool

- again give the permission of both the files to prometheus user we created
    - `sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus`
    - `sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/promtool`


- now lets move that one folder whichis responsibel for dashboarding and visualization --> consoles
    - `sudo cp -r consoles /etc/prometheus`
    - `sudo cp -r console_liberaries /etc/prometheus`

- again update the permissions
    - `sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/consoles`                 - `sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/console_liberaries`   

- note abobe -R flag is for changing pemission of that directory and all the files insde of it at the same time.

- lets copy the configuration file (.yaml) 
    - cp prometheus.yaml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yaml

- lets give permissions
    - `chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yaml`


- Now that everything is setup , lets run the prometheus server 

```
sudo -u prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus \
    --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yaml \
    -- storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
    --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/comsoles \
    -- web.console.liberaries=/etc/prometheus/console_liberaries
```

    - here -u flag is to run this command as prometheus user



-  creating a unit service file to run our prometheus using systemd

- file look like

```
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
[Service]
User=prometheus
Group=prometheus
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
--config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
--storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
--web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
--web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
